# Flight Order Management System - API Server

This is the backend server for the Flight Order Management System, a full-stack CRM application. It is a RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** that handles all business logic, data persistence, and user authentication for the platform.

## Core Features üöÄ

- **Secure Authentication:** User registration and login are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with password hashing (bcrypt).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware protects routes based on user roles (**Customer**, **Agent**, **Admin**), ensuring users can only access the data and perform the actions they are authorized for.
- **CRUD Operations:** Provides complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all major data models including Users, Orders, and Passengers.
- **Complex Business Logic:** Manages the entire multi-step order processing workflow, from creation to agent assignment and final customer approval.
- **External API Integration:** Includes proxy endpoints for fetching data from third-party weather and currency conversion services.

- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt.js
- **Validation:** Joi for validating incoming request bodies.
- **Logging:** Winston for logging application events and errors.
